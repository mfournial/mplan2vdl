{- Project: not dealing with ordered queries right now
note. project affects the name scope in the following ways

There are four cases illustrated below:
project (...) [ foo, bar as bar2, sum(bar, baz) as sumbaz, sum(bar, bar) ]

For the consumer to be able to see all relevant columns, we need
to solve the cases like this:

1) despite not having an 'as' keyword, foo should produce
(Vexprfoo, Just foo)
2) for bar, the alias is explicit:
(Vexprbar, Just bar2)
3) for sum(bar, baz), the alias is also explicit. this is the same
as case 2 actually. (Vexpr sum(bar, baz), sum2)
4) sum(bar, bar) could not be referred to in a consumer query,
but could be the topmost result, so we must return it as well.

that after filtering the right child, the old position pointers

can be anything, as the pointers are still valid.

 -user columns are only named with lowercase.
 -temporary columns are sometimes named things like L.L or L1.L1.
 -to the right of 'as', we get fully qualified names

eg [L1 as L1]. This means we cannot just use a map in those cases, since
