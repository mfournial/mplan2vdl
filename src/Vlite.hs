{- Project: not dealing with ordered queries right now
note. project affects the name scope in the following ways

There are four cases illustrated below:
project (...) [ foo, bar as bar2, sum(bar, baz) as sumbaz, sum(bar, bar) ]

For the consumer to be able to see all relevant columns, we need
to solve the cases like this:

1) despite not having an 'as' keyword, foo should produce
(Vexprfoo, Just foo)
2) for bar, the alias is explicit:
(Vexprbar, Just bar2)
3) for sum(bar, baz), the alias is also explicit. this is the same
as case 2 actually. (Vexpr sum(bar, baz), sum2)
4) sum(bar, bar) could not be referred to in a consumer query,
but could be the topmost result, so we must return it as well.
